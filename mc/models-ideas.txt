Users can create and design their own models in-game. Various 'model modifiers' can be found through dungeon loot.

Model modifiers control the display of a model.

Model modifier: "types"
- Armor stand (modify armour, arm positions, etc)
- Player (set to specific name, difference in name-tag to make clear is fake)
- Maybe custom MEG models?

Model modifier: "Look-nearest"
- Makes a model look at the nearest Player

Model modifier: "Voicebox"
- Makes a model trigger something on right-click

Model modifier: "Energized"
- Makes a model output a redstone signal to any in a 2x2 radius?
