# Trophies

_Trophies_ is a plugin designed to create "trophies" that players can earn through achieving milestones in certain statistics.

When a player completes a certain task (kill 1000 skeletons), the mob will drop a trophy of said type. It can then be placed at a location to enable it's active/passive effects.

## Trophy Tiers

Each trophy will have a set of possible tiers. Each milestone has their own tier.

- 1000 skeleton kills = tier 1 skeleton trophy
- 5000 skeleton kills = tier 2 skeleton trophy
- 10000 skeleton kills = tier 3 skeleton trophy

Each tier will have it's own unique design, meaning that each trophy has a cosmetic value, regardless of the type.

## Trophy Types

### Skeleton Trophy

#### Passive Effects

* Mob sound

#### Active Effects

Once activated, shoots arrows at nearby entities every X seconds.

- Tier 1: 5s/arrow, 5 radius, 10s activation time
- Tier 2: 2s/arrow, 7 radius, 20s activation time
- Tier 3: 1s/arrow, 10 radius, 30s activation time
- Tier 4: 0.5s/arrow, 12 radius, 1m activation time
- Tier 5: 0.25s/arrow, 15 radius, always active

### Enderman Trophy

Teleports itself to a random nearby location, unless powered by redstone.

### Blaze Trophy

Applies flame effects to projectiles shot through the trophy.

### Ender Dragon Trophy

Shoots bursts of XP out at random times.

### Wither Skeleton Trophy

Skeleton trophy, but with wither effects once the arrow lands.

### Passive Mob Trophies

- Each passive mob gets their own trophy, which play sounds when interacted with. Perhaps each mob trophy improves the chance of a mob of said type spawning.

# Gameplay Considerations

## Trophy Utility

Once you get the tier 2 skeleton trophy, what happens to the tier 1 trophy? They should remain as two different items, but will the tier 1 trophy still have a purpose?

Instead, should a single trophy be _upgradable_? i.e. each trophy you place automatically upgrades to the next tier. However, you would not be able to get multiple trophys of a mob type, unless other players trade with you.

- Trade implications are interesting, certain groups may offer high value to skeleton trophies, meaning that players may farm out their trophies for a large sum of money/resources.

- Players can only get each tier of each trophy once. Should they be craftable, somehow? Or keep them as a scarce, limited resource.

- Players may create rentable mob spawners to farm out mob kills for trophies, cool!

- One option would be to allow all trophies to be craftable, but mobs drop "trophy upgrade kits" that can be used to upgrade a trophy to it's next tier.
