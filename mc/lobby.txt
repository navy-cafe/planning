The lobby will be a cafe floating in the empty void of space.

Certain islands will be created for different purposes.
* pvp island
* island for each gamemode
* npc/scenery islands

Possibly have an "item catalogue" function that contains a list of items from all the navy cafe gamemodes. (i.e. bonk items, special enchanted items, etc, for testing/playing around purposes)
